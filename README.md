This was from a Kaggle competition called Two Sigma Recruiting: Renting Listings Inquiries. The basis was predicting users of the website RentHop interest in apartments in New York City. 

I used multiple machine learning techniques in this problem, including: neural networks, boosted trees, and k-nearest neighbors. Not surprisingly, k-nearest neighbors did not produce an adequate model for this problem. Boosted trees was the best and neural networks proved to be second.
